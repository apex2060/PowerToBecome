Purpose
-------
The purpose of this site is to tell the story of the people in Burkina Faso Africa.
We are working with many people to:
- build wells, 
- provide knowledge, tools, and support to
	- Build Fish Farms
	- Build Chicken Farms
	- Cultivate the land
	- 
	- 
In December we are going to Burkina Faso to organize this work 
and bring some of the leadership to Ganna to see how this can be accomplished.
We hope to provide others who want to participate with the opportunity to do so.
We would like to provide others with the ability to organize a service project
in which they gather around 30 similar items for Children, Youth, Men & Women.
We want to provide a story for both sides so both the giver and the receiver
can rejoice together.  Those who receive should also get the opportunity to see
and know the work and love of those who gave the gift.  Those who gave the gift 
should be able to see and know the gratitude of those who received the gift.

We will record and deliver your story with your gifts.
We will recode the reception and gratitude of those receiving.
